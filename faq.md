Various payment methods are accepted, including Stripe (PayPal, credit and debit cards), CS2 skins, and cryptocurrencies.

## Why is Stella Mod not open-source? <!-- {#not-open-source} -->
Stella Mod is not an open-source project for the following reasons:
1. The Software uses authentication mechanisms that should not be publicly available. Even with open source code, the application could not be compiled without the tokens for API communication.
2. The Author does not want the Software to be used maliciously, e.g., to distribute infected versions. In the past, when the project was open, someone published an infected version on GameBanana.
3. Keeping the code closed allows better control over the quality and security of the application, ensuring Users use the original and safe version of Stella Mod.
4. It also protects the work and effort put into developing the project. Open code could be copied, modified, or used in ways inconsistent with the Author's principles, which could harm the reputation of Stella Mod.
