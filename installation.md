## Step-by-Step Genshin Stella Mod Installation <!-- {#how-to-install-stella-mod} -->
### Step 1: Download the Official Installer <!-- {#download-installer} -->
Download the installer from the [official website](https://sefinek.net/genshin-stella-mod).

### Step 2: Run the Installer <!-- {#run-installer} -->
Do not install the Software in the game folder!
Installation takes approximately **20 seconds**, depending on your hard drive speed. The installer will automatically check for missing dependencies and download them if needed.

### Step 3: Launching the Launcher After Installation <!-- {#launch-stella-mod} -->
After closing the installer, launch the **Stella Mod Launcher** shortcut from the desktop if it was created during installation.
Otherwise, navigate to the folder where the Launcher was installed and run `Stella Mod Launcher.exe`.

### Step 4: Initial Software Configuration <!-- {#initial-configuration} -->
During the first launch, initial configuration will be required. Do not change any settings – just continue and wait a moment.

### Step 5: Launching Genshin Impact with Stella Mod <!-- {#start-game} -->
- Check the ReShade box if you want enhanced graphics in the game.
- Check the FPS Unlocker box to unlock the FPS limit (useful for monitors with a refresh rate higher than 60 Hz).
- Check the 3DMigoto box if you want to use mods in the game (e.g., character model swaps, etc.).

Then click the `Start Game` button.

### Step 6: Fine-Tuning Graphics Settings <!-- {#fine-tuning-graphics} -->
For an even better visual experience, adjust the graphics settings in the game.
