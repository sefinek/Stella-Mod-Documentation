## 📝 〢 Additional information (this is not legal advice)
1. The GPLv3 license, also known as the General Public License version 3, is a copyleft license.
  This means it allows the use of software covered by this license for commercial purposes.
  However, there is a key condition associated with this license: any derivative works created based on software licensed under GPLv3 must be made available as open-source software.
  In practice, this means that if you use software licensed under GPLv3 and create new software based on it, you are obligated to share the source code of these new works.
  In other words, other users must have access to the source code of your modifications and the ability to freely use, modify, and distribute that code in accordance with the terms of the GPLv3 license.
2. Stella Mod uses its own fork of 3DMigoto, optimized and tailored to our needs. **We do not use GIMI to ensure the highest quality, security, and full control over mod functionality.**
