# 📥 » v7.7.2
> **Date:** 17.08.2023 [DD.MM.YYYY]
## Visual Studio Project
1. The file `Genshin Stella Mod/Action.cs` is no longer publicly available.
2. Several unused files have been removed.

## Stella Mod Launcher
1. Certain optimizations have been implemented, eliminating duplicated code.
2. Changes have been made in the "Log files" category within the Tools window.
3. CMD files have been adapted to the latest version of Stella Mod.
4. Now, when a user clicks any button related to revealing logs twice, a certain information will be presented.
5. Added an `await Task.Delay(500);` to the `Client_DownloadFileCompleted` event, responsible for handling new update download completion.

## Genshin Stella Mod
1. The application now checks whether any arguments have been passed to it.
2. The application now verifies if the Launcher is properly configured.
3. Improved phrasing in most strings for consistency and coherence.
4. Fixed the error `Could not find a part of the path 'C:\Stella-Mod-Resources\ReShade\Presets\3. Only for patrons\start'`.
5. Fixed the error `System.IndexOutOfRangeException: Index was outside the bounds of the array`.
6. Re-added support for the Chinese game version YuanShen.exe.
7. Enhanced the code quality of `Cmd.cs`, responsible for launching applications like injectors, FPS Unlocker, and 3DMigoto loader.
8. Renamed the log file from `inject.output.log` to `gsmod.output.log`.
9. The application now saves more useful logs to the log file.
10. The application now checks if processes such as `GenshinImpact.exe`, `YuanShen.exe`, `launcher.exe`, `Stella Mod Launcher.exe`, `loader.exe`, `unlockfps_clr.exe` and `inject64.exe` are running. If so, the script will automatically terminate them. This increases the chance that new game features will be injected into the process correctly and safely.
11. Improved the appearance of CMD text.
12. This update also enhances a certain level of security.

## FPS Unlocker
1. The program has been compiled using the latest version of Visual Studio in a secure working environment.

4. An update button for ReShade configurations has been added to the Tools section.
5. Now, when the FPS unlocker configuration file is not found, the program will download it (as it did before), but this time, it will also update the current game localization.
