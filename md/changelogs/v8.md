# ðŸ“¥ Changelog for v8.0.0 from 12.03.2024 <!-- {#ver-800} -->

## Important Changes
1. Updated all projects to .NET 8. It is important to note that the access path to the `Stella Mod Launcher.exe` file has changed. This may require updates to shortcuts and other references to this file.
2. Genshin Stella Mod now includes a built-in Windows Terminal. Users can remove this dependency from their systems (e.g., from the Microsoft Store) if they do not use it.

## Project Updates
1. Updated application icons, including the official Stella Mod launcher, hoping for a positive reception from users.
2. Moved pseudo-documentation from the `README.md` file to the official website. Now, `README.md` contains only key information, primarily links to documentation. Also improved the readability of documentation pages.
3. Updated the official Genshin Stella Mod website, enhancing its intuitiveness and aesthetics.
4. Reorganized files in the GitHub repository, improving their clarity and making it easier to search.
5. Updated data in `AssemblyInfo.cs` for several applications.
6. Updated all NuGet packages to the latest versions.
7. Updated and corrected application manifests.
8. Significantly improved optimization and code quality across all projects.
9. Updated the API to version v6.
10. Removed numerous, now unnecessary files from the `Resources` directory.

## Stella Mod Launcher
1. Implemented `DoubleBuffered` for smoother rendering of controls, which should reduce flickering.
2. Added MoeCounter, using WebView2, to track the number of launcher starts. Data is stored locally and not sent to the server.
3. Removed `Microsoft.Toolkit.Uwp.Notifications`, replacing it with our solution for system notifications (`BalloonTip.Show`).
4. Improved the update mechanism, enhancing handling and speed of installing new versions.
5. Introduced the use of `HttpClient` for more efficient file downloading, increasing speed.
6. Rounded the corners of the application, giving it a more modern look.
7. Improved application shutdown signal handling, ensuring proper disappearance of the icon from the system tray.
8. Allowed users to add their own background to the launcher, stored in `net8.0-windows\data\images\backgrounds\main`.
9. Improved Polish translations.
10. Enhanced the application's language change feature.
11. Optimized application startup time.

## Genshin Stella Mod
1. Genshin Stella Mod application is no longer available as an open-source project, due to security reasons.
2. Improved application performance, increasing its operating speed.
3. Made general quality improvements.

## FPS Unlocker
1. Added an application icon in the main window.
2. Implemented general quality improvements.

## InnoSetup Installer
