This update focuses on both client and server-side optimizations, ensuring a smoother and more efficient application performance.

## Important to Understand
1. **User Privacy is Paramount**: We want to reassure our users that none of our programs collect any user data for marketing purposes. The Stella Mod Launcher only gathers data on the number of application launches, which are securely transmitted to our servers. Rest assured, no third party has access to this information except the local administrator. The data is sent to servers located in Poland, owned by SefinIT, ensuring that your information stays safe and private.

## Key Changes
1. **Enhanced Security and Performance**: This update brings significant security enhancements and numerous internal improvements to make the application run more smoothly.
2. **Faster File Downloads**: We have addressed the issue of slow file downloads. With this update, Stella Mod Launcher will download files at a much faster rate.
3. **New API v7**: Released a new version of our API, which includes many changes to improve communication with the remote server.
4. **Closed Source Transition**: For security reasons, Stella Mod Launcher and related applications will no longer be available as open-source software. This change helps us maintain better control over the code and enhance security.
5. **Log Sending Feature**: A new window has been added to allow users to safely send Stella Mod logs to our server.
6. **Support for HoYoPlay**: Added support for the new HoYoverse launcher called HoYoPlay. The MiHoYo launcher (Á±≥ÂìàÊ∏∏ÂêØÂä®Âô®) is also supported.
    
## Minor Changes
