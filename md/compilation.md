Due to the implementation of new security measures, as of May 2024, significant changes will be introduced to the Stella Mod software compilation process in Visual Studio Code 2022.
These changes are aimed at enhancing user security.
Consequently, Stella Mod Launcher and Genshin Stella Mod will no longer be available as open-source projects.
This decision is driven by the necessity to protect the source code from unauthorized access and modifications that could jeopardize the application's functionality or safety.
Limiting access to the code is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of Stella Mod.

Additionally, to further bolster security, new measures to protect the API have been implemented.
These include authentication and encryption techniques designed to prevent unauthorized access and attacks on Stella Mod's programming interface.
Securing the API is vital for safeguarding data exchanged between applications and for ensuring user privacy.

Commitment to safety and integrity doesn't end with these initial changes.
In the future, the Stella Mod team plans to regularly review and update safety protocols to combat evolving cybersecurity threats.
This proactive approach ensures that Stella Mod remains at the forefront of secure software development, protecting players (end-users) from potential security breaches.
