## üç∞ „Ä¢ Used background music in Stella Mod Launcher <!-- {#bg-music-in-sml} -->
For the development of the official launcher, we have incorporated a selection of soundtracks from the popular game Genshin Impact.
These soundtracks, known for their immersive and high-quality compositions, have been integrated to enhance the user experience of the launcher, providing an engaging and thematic auditory backdrop.
The audio tracks used were sourced from the comprehensive collection available at the following URL: https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/genshin-impact-gamerip.
This collection includes a wide range of musical pieces from the game, allowing us to select tracks that best fit the aesthetic and functional needs of our launcher.
The use of these soundtracks from Genshin Impact aligns with our goal of creating an immersive and enjoyable user interface, complementing the visual elements with equally captivating audio.
