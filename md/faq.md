# üî¢ What is a UID?
A `UID`, or `User Identification Number`, is a unique identifier assigned to each user account in a game.

# üòø Can I get ban?
Disclosing your UID can increase your risk of being banned from a game or application. Some games have strict rules against using mods or cheats, and if you're caught, you could be banned.
`Stella Mod is generally safe to use`, but there is still a risk involved when using mods or cheats. The anti-cheat system in some games can detect the use of these tools and result in a ban.
If you get banned, it's important to respect the game rules and not try to bypass the ban. If you believe that the ban was unjustified, you can contact the game's support team to appeal the ban.

In summary, while the **chance of being banned for using FPS unlocker or ReShade is slim**, users should be aware of the potential risks and use these tools responsibly.
It's also essential to keep your UID private and follow good security practices to avoid any potential issues.

# ü§î Is using mods or cheats illegal?
It depends on the game or application's terms of service. Some games allow the use of mods, while others strictly prohibit them.

Cheating is generally considered unethical and can result in penalties, such as being banned.
Personally, I don't see the point in cheating in Genshin Impact. The game is meant to be enjoyed and challenges are part of that enjoyment.

# üõ°Ô∏è How can I report a cheater in a game?
If you suspect that someone is cheating in a game, you can usually report them to the game's support team.
It's important to provide as much detail as possible, such as the player's username and the specific behavior you observed.
However, it's important to avoid making false accusations or harassing other players.

# üí® Can I avoid a ban while using Stella Mod?
The best way to avoid a ban is to follow the rules of the game.
However, as a responsible developer, I strive to provide maximum safety for my users.

My Patrons have access to a private DNS server with Pi-hole and Unbound installed, which can block telemetry from MiHoYo and protect against other dangerous websites.
This can significantly reduce the risk of getting banned while using third-party software.
Nonetheless, it is important to remember that the use of any mods is not endorsed by the game developers and carries some level of risk.

## üî∞ What is the private DNS server that patrons have access to?
Patrons who purchase the appropriate tier of support have access to a private DNS server with Pi-hole and Unbound installed.
This server can be used to block telemetry from games such as Genshin Impact and protect against other potentially harmful websites.

## üçí What is Pi-hole and Unbound?
Pi-hole is a free, open-source software designed to block malware, ads, and tracking on the internet.
It works by acting as a DNS sinkhole, blocking domain names associated with advertising, tracking, and other unwanted content.
Unbound, on the other hand, is a free, open-source DNS resolver that provides secure, private, and fast DNS resolution. It is designed to protect against DNS spoofing and other security vulnerabilities.

## üìÉ How does this help protect against telemetry and bans?
Telemetry is data that is sent from your device to a third-party server without your explicit consent.
Many games, including Genshin Impact, use telemetry to collect information about how the game is played, how often it is played, and other data.
By blocking telemetry at the DNS level with Pi-hole, patrons can prevent this data from being sent and protect their privacy.

Additionally, using a private DNS server with Unbound can help protect against DNS-based bans.
Some games and applications use DNS to verify the location of a user, and if the user is found to be using a VPN or other location-hiding service, they may be banned.
By using Unbound, patrons can ensure that their DNS queries are secure and cannot be intercepted or manipulated by a third party.

### üìä What are telemetry and data collection?
Telemetry is the process of collecting data about software usage and performance.
However, some users may be concerned about the privacy implications of this data collection.
It's important to read and understand the privacy policies of any software you use and to configure your settings accordingly.

## ‚òò How do I set up the private DNS server?
Patrons who have purchased the appropriate tier of support can access instructions for setting up the private DNS server on the Patreon page. It is important to follow the instructions carefully.

## üí• Is it guaranteed to protect against all telemetry and bans?
No, using a private DNS server with Pi-hole and Unbound is not a foolproof method for avoiding telemetry and bans. It can help increase privacy and security, but it is not a guarantee.
It is still important to follow best practices for online security and privacy, such as using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and avoiding suspicious websites and downloads.

Overall, using a private DNS server with Pi-hole and Unbound is a great way to increase privacy and security when using the internet, and it can help protect against telemetry and bans.
However, it is important to remember that it is not a guaranteed solution, and it is still essential to follow the rules of the game or application to avoid being banned.
Patrons who have purchased the appropriate tier of support can access instructions for setting up the server and start enjoying the benefits of a safer, more private online experience.

# ‚ò¢ More mods?
Modding has become a popular way for gamers to customize their gameplay experience and add new elements to their favorite games. However, with the freedom and flexibility that modding provides comes a degree of responsibility. It's crucial to exercise caution when using mods and prioritize the safety and security of both the game and the user.

One of the most important steps in safe modding is to only download and install mods from reputable sources. This can help protect the game from malicious attacks and the user from potential harm, such as viruses or malware. It's recommended to research the mod and the modding community before installing anything, and to always download from trusted sources such as official modding forums or websites.

It's also important to note that some mods may contain NSFW (+18) content or other inappropriate material that can negatively affect the user's experience. These types of mods can not only harm the user but also violate the game's terms of service, potentially leading to penalties such as being banned. It's crucial to avoid these mods and to thoroughly read through the mod description and reviews before installing anything.

In addition to using caution when downloading and installing mods, it's important to keep them up to date. Modders may release updates to fix bugs or improve performance, and using an outdated mod can cause issues or conflicts with the game.

## üêõ Can I use more mods?
It's important to note that the Stella Mod is specifically designed to work with ReShade and FPS Unlocker.
Therefore, it's recommended that users avoid adding any additional mods that may interfere with the mod's functionality.
The developer have optimized the mod carefully to work seamlessly with ReShade and FPS Unlocker, and adding more mods can disrupt this optimization, leading to conflicts that can cause the game to crash or other technical issues.

Using mods in any game carries inherent risks, especially in online multiplayer games like Genshin Impact.
Mods can enhance gameplay, but they can also cause technical issues, trigger anti-cheat systems, or even result in permanent bans from the game.
Users should always read and understand the terms of service and community guidelines before using mods.

To summarize, while the Stella Mod can enhance your Genshin Impact experience, it's crucial to use it correctly and avoid adding any additional mods that may interfere with its functionality.
Users should exercise caution when using mods in any game and be aware of the potential risks involved.

## üò¨ Can I edit the Stella Mod to add more mods?
Users have the right to modify files from repository `sefinek24/Genshin-Impact-ReShade`, but it's important to understand that doing so carries inherent risks.
Users do it at their own risk and responsibility, and injecting additional mods besides ReShade and FPS Unlocker may result in an immediate ban in the game.
Therefore, users should exercise caution and avoid modifying the mod unless they are confident in their abilities and understand the potential risks involved.

Furthermore, modifying the Genshin Stella Mod requires a certain level of technical expertise and knowledge.
Users should only attempt to modify the mod if they feel confident in their abilities and understand the potential risks involved.

## üö´ Other mods, where to get support?
We do not provide support for mods other than ReShade and FPS Unlocker, and users should not seek help regarding these mods on our Discord server. Using additional mods can cause technical issues, disrupt the optimization and functionality of the Stella Mod, and even result in an immediate ban in the game. Therefore, users who decide to modify the mod by injecting other mods do so at their own risk and responsibility. The Stella Mod team is not responsible for any bans that may occur as a result of using additional mods.

It's worth noting that modifying the Launcher to make it compatible with other mods violates the terms of use for the application. Consequently, the Genshin Stella Mod team cannot provide support for any issues related to Launcher modification. While mods can enhance gameplay, they can also have unforeseen consequences, and it is crucial to understand the potential risks involved.

If you encounter any problems with the Stella Mod while using ReShade and FPS Unlocker, you can seek help on our Discord server or consult the mod's documentation. However, please understand that we cannot provide assistance for any issues related to additional mods, and users should not seek such help on our Discord server.

Avoid sharing your login credentials with anyone, and stay alert to phishing scams designed to steal your information.
Keeping your software and devices up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates is also essential in preventing hacking attempts.
