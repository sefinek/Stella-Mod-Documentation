## Why is Stella Mod Not Open-Source?
Stella Mod is not open-source for the following reasons:

- Stella Mod uses authentication mechanisms that should not be publicly available. Even if the code were open, the application could not be compiled without access to the tokens used for API communication.
- We don't want Stella Mod to be misused, e.g., for distributing infected versions. In the past, when Stella Mod was open-source, someone created an infected version and published it on Gamebanana, where proper safeguards, such as antivirus scanning, were lacking. Therefore, always ensure you download Stella Mod from a trusted source like sefinek.net.
- Keeping the code closed allows us to better manage the quality and security of the application. This ensures that users are using the original and safe version of Stella Mod.
- We also protect our work and effort invested in developing the application. Open-source code could be copied, modified, and used in ways that contradict our principles, potentially harming Stella Mod's reputation.
