### 😻 What is Genshin Stella Mod? {#what-is-genshin-stella-mod}
My mod pack is designed to enhance your gameplay experience in Genshin Impact by adding new visual effects to the already stunning world of Teyvat.
Whether you're looking for a more vibrant and colorful world or a more realistic and cinematic experience, Stella Mod has something for everyone.

One of the most impressive features of my mod pack is its ability to unlock FPS and enhance the game's graphics using ReShade, resulting in improved performance and a more immersive gameplay experience. 
I want to make it clear that the FPS unlocker and ReShade components were not created by me. However, my mod pack has been designed to work seamlessly with these tools to provide you with the best possible gaming experience.

Genshin Stella Mod supports 3DMigoto, but currently it's [only available for Stella Mod Plus subscribers](/genshin-impact-reshade/subscription). With the aid of this software, players have the ability to further modify the game, enhancing their gaming experience. However, it is crucial to exercise caution and responsibility while using these modifications to avoid any negative consequences that may arise from such alterations.
Remember, the key is to approach game modding with a sense of reason and refrain from indulging in excessive or inappropriate modifications that could potentially lead to undesirable outcomes.
By being mindful of the changes made, players can ensure that their gaming remains enjoyable and respectful of the original intent of the game developers.

At my core, I prioritize delivering the best possible experience to my users, which is why I remain committed to providing ongoing support and assistance.
If you encounter any issues with the mod pack or have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me on my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Yj7fnafTXf). 😊
