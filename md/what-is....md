# ðŸ–¼ ...ReShade?
ReShade is a post-processing tool that allows players to apply a wide range of visual effects to their games, including depth of field, bloom, and color correction.
ReShade works by injecting code into the game's rendering pipeline, allowing it to apply its effects in real-time.

## ðŸŒ· Benefits
One of the key benefits of using ReShade is the ability to customize your game's visuals to your liking.
ReShade includes a wide range of built-in effects and also allows players to create and share their custom shaders.
This means that you can tweak your game's visuals to your exact preferences, whether you prefer a more realistic look or a more stylized and vibrant one. Another benefit of using ReShade is that it can be used in conjunction with other mods and tweaks.
For example, players can use ReShade alongside an FPS unlocker to create an even more immersive and visually stunning experience.

## ðŸ‘¿ Drawbacks
However, it's important to note that using ReShade can sometimes have a negative impact on game performance.
As ReShade injects code into the game's rendering pipeline, it can cause additional strain on your system's CPU and GPU, leading to lower frame rates or other performance issues, especially on lower-end hardware.
Another consideration when using ReShade is that some games may not be compatible with it, or may even block it from running altogether.
Some anti-cheat systems may also flag ReShade as a potential security risk, which can lead to issues with online play.

## ðŸ’¬ Conclusion
Overall, ReShade is a powerful tool that can enhance the visual quality of your games, but it's important to use it carefully and be aware of its potential impact on performance and compatibility.
If you're interested in using ReShade with the Genshin Stella Mod Pack, follow the installation instructions carefully and test the mod pack thoroughly to ensure that everything is working as intended.


# ðŸŒ  ...FPS unlocker?
Unlocking FPS in video games can greatly enhance the gaming experience by providing smoother gameplay and reducing input lag.
However, it's important to consider several factors before using an FPS unlocker.

## ðŸŒ» About
FPS unlocking is the process of removing the artificial limit on the maximum number of frames a video game can render per second.
By default, most video games have an FPS cap set by developers to ensure the game runs smoothly on a wide range of hardware configurations.
However, for gamers with high-end hardware, this cap can be frustrating, as they cannot fully utilize their system's potential to run the game at higher frame rates.
Unlocking FPS can be achieved through various methods, but it's important to note that it can cause stability issues and other technical problems if done incorrectly.

## ðŸŽ® Considerations
When it comes to unlocking FPS, it's crucial to consider several factors. One important consideration is the refresh rate of your monitor.
If your monitor has a low refresh rate of 60Hz or lower, unlocking FPS may not have any noticeable effect on your gaming experience.
However, if you have a monitor with a higher refresh rate, such as 120Hz or 165Hz, unlocking FPS can make a significant difference in terms of smoothness and responsiveness.

It's also essential to note that unlocking FPS can sometimes cause instability in games, especially in poorly optimized games or those that use a lot of system resources.
In some cases, unlocking FPS can even cause game crashes or other issues, so it's important to proceed with caution when using FPS unlockers.

Another consideration when it comes to unlocking FPS is the impact on your hardware. Running games at higher frame rates can put additional strain on your CPU and GPU, causing your system to run hotter and potentially reducing its lifespan.
Before unlocking FPS, it's important to make sure that your computer is equipped to handle the increased load. ðŸ”¥

## ðŸ™€ Benefits of Unlocking FPS
Unlocking FPS can significantly improve the overall gaming experience by providing smoother and more responsive gameplay.
Higher FPS reduces input lag and improves the accuracy of mouse movements, making it easier to aim and perform precise movements in the game.
Moreover, unlocking FPS is especially beneficial for competitive gamers who need the best possible performance to gain an advantage over their opponents.
It can help them achieve higher frame rates, which can make all the difference in fast-paced, action-packed games.

In summary, FPS unlocking can greatly enhance your gaming experience, but it's essential to do so only when it makes sense for your hardware and monitor. It's important to proceed with caution and understand the potential risks and downsides before attempting to unlock FPS in Genshin Impact.
