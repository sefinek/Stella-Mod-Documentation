# Understanding ReShade and FPS Unlocking

## What Is ReShade? <!-- {#reshade} -->
ReShade is a post-processing tool that allows the User to apply various visual effects in games, such as depth of field, bloom, or color correction.  
It works by injecting code into the game's rendering process, enabling real-time visual effects.  
Press the `Home` key in-game to open the menu and create your own presets!

## What Is FPS Unlocking? <!-- {#fps-unlocking} -->
Unlocking FPS in video games can significantly improve the gameplay experience by providing smoother animations and reducing input latency.  
However, before using an FPS unlocker, it's important to consider several factors.

### How FPS Unlocking Works <!-- {#about-fps-unlocking} -->
FPS unlocking removes the artificial frame rate limit.  
By default, most games include a built-in FPS cap imposed by the developers, often for compatibility reasons.

### What to Know Before Unlocking FPS <!-- {#fps-unlocking-considerations} -->
1. If your monitor has a low refresh rate (e.g., 60Hz), unlocking FPS will not improve smoothness and may only increase hardware temperatures.  
   In such cases, do not use an FPS Unlocker.  
   On the other hand, users with high-refresh-rate monitors (e.g., 120Hz or 165Hz) may notice a significant improvement in smoothness and responsiveness.

2. Running games at higher frame rates increases GPU load, which may result in higher temperatures.  
   There is no reason to set a 500 FPS limit on a 165Hz monitor.
